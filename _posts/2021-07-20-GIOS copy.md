## Introduction

This is the first of ten classes I chose to take for my masters in computer science, because a bachelor's wasn't enough pain, or maybe my hubris was too big for my britches.
I had a brief run in a class the previous semester, IIS; however the first assignment had some issues with portability and I scored a zero, thankfully it was before the drop deadline, but I learned my lesson as to not take any graduate level computer science class lightly.

At the time of me writing this, I finished the class about 3 months ago and received an A for my efforts, despite doing about average on all exams and not finishing a portion of the first assignment, a decision that I made after spending about fifty hours in a week, due to lack of experience with C or any low level networking APIs.

## Lectures

I hope you like Elves, the lectures are chalk full of them.
Ada's teaching style is really quite good and the lectures can be extremely dense and require multiple watches to ingest in any meaningful way


## Takeaways

We stand on the shoulders of many specialized builders

Abstraction is how humans make progress

There are no win-win design situations, only tradeoffs
